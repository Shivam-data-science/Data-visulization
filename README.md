● Clear and concise communication skills.
Deliverables:
● A Google document containing solutions to the scenario-based questions including the screenshot of
relevant chart picked for each scenario, presented in a concise and well-structured format. Make sure to
provide explanations that highlight your problem-solving skills.
Rubrics for Assessment:
Question Responses:
● Accuracy and completeness of answers for all 30 questions.
● Clear and concise explanations that address the question's context.
Chart Selection and Explanation:
● Thoughtful rationale for choosing specific chart types.
● Justification based on data characteristics, context, and communication goals.

● Enhancements that contribute to better understanding or engagement.
Note:
● Duplicate this document and proceed to write your solutions.
● For each scenario and question, provide a justification for the choice of chart type. Explain why it is the
best option to visualise the data effectively.
● Attach screenshots of the charts you have created in Tableau for each scenario and question using the
Superstore dataset. Label them clearly to match the corresponding questions in the Google Document.
● Submit the duplicated google doc file after completion.
Use these guidelines to structure your data visualisation and analysis project. Remember to maintain consistency
in your responses, explanations, and visualisation styles. This project will not only demonstrate your skills but
also your ability to effectively communicate complex information through visualisations. Good luck!
Problem Statement: Choose the Best chart for any 30
scenario-based questions from Superstore Dataset.
Imagine you are a data enthusiast aiming to excel in data visualisation and analysis. In this task, you have been
given any 30 scenario-based questions derived from the Superstore dataset, and your objective is to provide
insightful answers using appropriate charts. For each question, you need to select a chart that best represents the
data, explain why you chose that specific chart, and then proceed to build the chosen chart using Tableau.
Your responses should be succinct, organised, and illustrative of your problem-solving capabilities.
